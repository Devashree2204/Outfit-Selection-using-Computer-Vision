Outfit Selection Using Computer Vision 

An outfit selection system based on computer vision that recommends an outfit based not just on gender but also
on real-time temperature and the sort of event to attend.

Fashion Mnist dataset, which included approximately 60,000 training photos and 10,000 testing images. CNN, also
known as Convolutional neural networks, was used to extract features and classify images.

Python was used for coding, and the OpenWeatherMap API was used to retrieve real-time temperature for
locations.

The camera was integrated, and photos were collected independently for the top and bottom and kept in a
separate local database.
